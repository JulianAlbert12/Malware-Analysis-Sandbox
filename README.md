# User Authentication. (Security project)
The goal of this project is to develop a malware analysis sandbox, a secure and isolated environment for analyzing potentially malicious files and understanding their behavior without risking the integrity of the host system. The sandbox will provide me with a platform to execute, monitor, and analyze malware samples in a controlled environment.
